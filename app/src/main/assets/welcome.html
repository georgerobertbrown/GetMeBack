<h2>Overview</h2>
This app allows you to mark a location and then easily get directions to return. This is useful for example if you park your car and go shopping and
then forget where your car is.<br/>
<h3>Location</h3>
GetMeBack uses your phone's location services as well as Google Map's turn-by-turn directions to return to the marked location. Navigation modes are:
<ol>
    <li>Driving</li>
    <li>Walking</li>
</ol>
When the app is launched the first time, it will request location permission. <i>Precise location</i> mode must be selected.

<h2>Home screen widget</h2>
A Home screen widget can be created to quickly set the current location and return to the destination. Steps:
<ol>
    <li>long-press on the Home screen</li>
    <li>select <i>Widgets</i></li>
    <li>click <i>GetMeBack</i></li>
    <li>press and hold the widget preview icon <img src="widget_preview1.png"></li>
    <li>drag the widget to the Home screen</li>
</ol>
