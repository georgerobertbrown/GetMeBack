<h2>Overview</h2>
GetMeBack allows you to mark a location and then easily get directions to return. This is useful for example if you park your car and go shopping and then forget where your car is. Locations can be assigned a name and restored for future use. For example, you can have a location named <i>Home</i>, <i>Work</i>, <i>Gym</i>, etc.<br/>
<h3>Location</h3>
The app uses your phone's location services as well as Google Map's turn-by-turn directions to return to the marked location. Navigation modes are:
<ol>
    <li> Driving</li>
    <li> Walking</li>
    <li> Bicycle</li>
    <li> Transit</li>
</ol>
When the app is launched the first time, it will request location permission. <i>Precise location</i> mode <i>While using this app</i> <b>MUST</b> be selected for the app to function properly as shown <img src="allow_precise_location.png">. Refer to Help for additional details.<br/>
<h3>Notifications</h3>
