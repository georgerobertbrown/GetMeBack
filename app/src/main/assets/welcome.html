<h2>Overview</h2>
This app allows you to mark a location and then easily get directions to return. This is useful for example if you park your car and go shopping and
then forget where your car is.<br/>
<h4>Location</h4>
GetMeBack uses your phone's location services as well as Google Map's turn-by-turn directions to return to the marked location. Navigation modes are:
<ol>
    <li>Driving</li>
    <li>Walking</li>
</ol>
When the app is launched the first time, it will request location permission. <i>Precise location</i> mode must be selected.
