<h2>Overview</h2>
GetMeBack allows you to mark a location and then easily get directions to return. This is useful for example if you park your car and go shopping and
then forget where your car is.<br/>
<h3>Location</h3>
The app uses your phone's location services as well as Google Map's turn-by-turn directions to return to the marked location. Navigation modes are:
<ol>
    <li>Driving</li>
    <li>Walking</li>
</ol>
When the app is launched the first time, it will request location permission. <i>Precise location</i> mode <b>MUST</b> be selected for the app to function properly. Refer to Help for additional details.
